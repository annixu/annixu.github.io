            <h1> Obesity in Pacific Islands </h1>
            <p>The Pacific islands are home to nine of the top 10 countries for obesity globally. Rates of obesity range
            from 35% to 50% in the region and one in five children are estimated to be obese.

            <br><br>Poor diets and reduced exercise have become a major public health concern for the region as they
            are not only a cause of obesity -- associated diseases are also rife, such as heart disease, stroke and
            diabetes, the latter of which has a known genetic basis among locals.
